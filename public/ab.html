    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are HyperDyne, we made Konnect!</p>
    <p>Konnect! is made using Ruby Sinatra and its very useful erb file type. Konnect! Currently does not have a db, but it is made to have a db connected to it, meaning it could become a reality! This is just an offline version to show off what it would be like if it was real.</p>
